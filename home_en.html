        <h3> About us </h3>

        <p>
            We sell music, have a recordlabel and we develop some games from time to time.
        </p>

        <h4>Artists</h4>
        <p>
            Some artists we are currently working with are:
        <ul>
            <li>Phil Collins</li>
            <li>Dire Straits</li>
            <li>The Rolling Stones</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Styles</h4>
        <p>
            Some of the music styles we are working in at the moment are:
        <ul>
            <li>Rock</li>
            <li>80s Pop</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>New artists/styles</h4>
        <p>
            Of course the music industry never stands still, it always keeps moving.
            That's why we are always looking for new artists and new styles to work with.<br>
            Some new styles we are particularly looking for are:
        <ul>
            <li>Rap</li>
            <li>Hip Hop</li>
            <li>Jazz</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>What a music publisher does</h4>
        <p>
            A music publisher deals in musical works and the copyrights attached to those musical works. We therefore do
            not deal in the recordings themselves, but in the copyrights that are attached to the recordings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you might think, isnt that what a record label does? But the answer to that is no.
            A music publisher concludes publishing contracts with the composers and lyricists, they are the creators of
            the music. <br>
            A record label concludes contracts with artists and bands, they are the performing musicians. The record
            company deals in, among other things, the neighboring rights attached to the recordings themselves. They
            also guide and promote the artists and recordings.
        </p>

        <h4>Own platform</h4>
        <p>
            Every artist that signs a contract with us will get their own platform within the website.
