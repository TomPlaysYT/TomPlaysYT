        <p>
        A few years ago, on the 1st of March 2010, Jan van Zuilen (and his silent partner) established a small company in the music business.
        At first he focussed solely on selling media carriers succh as CDs and DVDs.

        In the first few years the company was doing quite well.
        After the first branch in Rotterdam, Jan was able to establish a second branch in Dordrecht in 2015.

        However, over the years, the streaming of video and music started to develop more and more.
        Streamingservices such as: Spotify, Soundcloud, Netflix and Videoland started gaining a bigger and bigger marketshare.
        </p>

        <p>
        Because of the quickly increasing popularity of streaming content, 
        Jan decided last year it would be a good idea to launch his own online music streaming platform.
